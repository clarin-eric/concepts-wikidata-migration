# Mappings from CLARIN concepts to Wikidata entities

This repository is used to maintain mappings from concepts that have been registered
in the [CLARIN Concept Registry](https://concepts.clarin.eu/ccr/) (CCR) to 
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) entities (items and properties).

The mapping is intended to be applied to the CLARIN metadata infrastructure,
specifically the [Component Registry](https://catalog.clarin.eu/ds/ComponentRegistry/),
[Virtual Language Observatory](https://vlo.clarin.eu) (VLO), and as annotations to
the Concept Registry itself.

## Background

The CLARIN Concept Registry has been populated with terms that are created by individual researchers or projects. This organic growth has led to inconsitency and duplication. In order to solve this problem, the TF-CLARIN team started in June 2024 a project to map the CCR concepts to Wikidata terms.

For this purpose, we used semi-automatic mappings based on string matching to wikidata items or properties. The semi-automatic matching resulted in a series of candidate mappings. These went through several rounds of manual validations, not only by the team members, but also involvind different collaborators within CLARIN. In the final stage before releasing v1.1, a round of manual evaluation to a sample of items was included, after which the final selection of mappings was made and integrated in the VLO.


## Version history

### v1.1 (September 2025)

* 693 verified mappings
* Applied to the Component Registry and VLO on 26 September 2025

This is an overview of the results offered in v1.1 (see below) include:

- We started with 3079 CCR concepts.
- From those 3079, 933 concepts are actually used (by individuals or projects).
- Mappings to wikidata were found for 693 concepts, out of which 404 are used concepts.

The file "CCR-concepts-to-wikidata-v1-1_complete_metadata_with_provenance.csv" includes more detailed metadata and provenance information (i.e., indicating if the mapping originates from manual validation, manual inputation, or an automatic matching via an ISOCAT Id).
  
### v1.0 (September 2025)

Unpublished, not applied
